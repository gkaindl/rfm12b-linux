  Jee-compatible mode differs from normal operation by these traits
  
  1) The first two bytes of a packet (header and length) are passed
     to user-space via read(), so you can inspect them.
  2) When you pass data to send via write(), the first two bytes of
     the data are the Jee header and length bytes. If the length byte
     does not match the actual packet length, it will be automatically
     fixed by the driver.
  3) The driver can automatically send Jee ACKs for packets that
     request them (see RFM12B_DEFAULT_JEE_AUTOACK).

  The RFM12b has a FFOV (rx register overflow) and an RGUR (tx register
  underflow) field in the status word. Those should be set if there was
  an overflow of data while receiving (e.g. you're not reading data fast
  enough) or if you don't supply bits to be sent fast enough, respectively.
  
  However, I'm not sure if I understand those fields correctly, as disregarding
  them seems to improve reliability a lot â€“ I need to investigate this further.
  Thus, you can enable/disable the behavior to regard a send/recv as failed
  when these bits are set in the status register.
  
  Note that even if the "drop packet" behavior is disabled, you are still
  protected against corrupted data by the internal CRC16 checksum.
  
  Tip: Leave these at defaults, unless you're actively investigating this.
